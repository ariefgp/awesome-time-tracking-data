## Overview
Automated time tracking refers to tools that run in the background to capture how time is spent on tasks, applications, and websites with minimal manual input. These tools help individuals and teams accurately log billable hours, analyze productivity, and reduce the effort of entering time manually. Captured activity can be converted into timesheet entries for reporting, or kept private to the individual, depending on settings.

## Features

  - Runs automatically in the background while you work.  
  - Monitors usage of apps and websites to build an activity record.

- **App and website-specific tracking**  
  - Switch on automated tracking for specific apps or websites.  
  - Capture how much time is spent on particular tools or online resources.

- **Convert activity to time entries**  
  - Team members can review tracked activity and convert it into formal time entries.  
  - Supports accurate reporting for projects, clients, and internal work.

- **Privacy controls**  
  - If activity is not turned into time entries, it remains private to the individual user.  
  - Designed to provide useful time data without intrusive surveillance.

- **Multi-platform time capture (contextual)**  
  - Time can also be tracked via web, desktop, mobile, and browser extensions, complementing automated background tracking.
