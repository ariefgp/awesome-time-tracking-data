  ## Overview

  Qmonix Lua SDK is a Lua client library for sending events and metrics from Lua

  analytics server.

  - **Metrics collection:** Capture metrics such as task durations and other
  quantitative measures for analytics.

  (e.g., tracking task durations in tools like Awesome Time Tracker).

  - **Lua-native client:** Implemented as a Lua library for easy integration
  into existing Lua-based projects.

  - **Server communication:** Transmits collected events and metrics to a remote
  Qmonix analytics server for storage and analysis.


  ## Integrations & Use Cases

  - **Awesome Time Tracker:** Can be used to send time-tracking events and task
  duration metrics from Awesome Time Tracker (or similar apps) to Qmonix.

  - **Custom Lua applications:** Suitable for any Lua-powered application that
  needs to log events and metrics to a Qmonix backend.
