# About Us

## We Help You Stop Wasting Time Looking for Time Tracking Tools

Here's the problem: there are over 200 time tracking apps out there. Some are amazing. Most are mediocre. A few are downright terrible. And figuring out which is which? That's a full-time job nobody has time for.

That's why we built this directory.

We've spent years testing, comparing, and organizing these tools so you don't have to. Whether you're a freelancer tracking billable hours, a team lead managing projects, or a productivity nerd optimizing your day—we'll help you find your perfect match in minutes, not weeks.

## What Makes Us Different

### We Actually Test These Tools

We're not just scraping data from company websites. Our team uses these tools, explores their features, and keeps our listings current. When pricing changes or new features launch, we update our directory. When a tool shuts down, we remove it.

Real reviews. Real testing. Real information.

### We're Time Tracking Obsessed

While other directories list everything from accounting software to project management platforms, we focus exclusively on one thing: helping you track your time better.

This specialization means deeper insights, better comparisons, and actually understanding what matters—like whether a tool has reliable offline mode, clean invoicing, or won't drain your phone's battery.

### No BS, No Bias

We list both the $200/month enterprise platforms and the free indie apps. Popular tools and hidden gems. If it's quality software, it belongs here.

We don't take payments for better placement. We don't hide the alternatives. We just show you what's out there and help you decide.

## What You'll Find Here

**Smart Filtering** - Find tools by features (automatic tracking, GPS, integrations), platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux), pricing (free, freemium, subscription), or use case (freelancing, teams, billing, productivity).

**Honest Comparisons** - See pros, cons, pricing, and what users actually think. No marketing fluff.

**Time Tracking Resources** - Guides, best practices, and strategies for better productivity and time management.

**Active Community** - Real reviews from freelancers, agencies, and teams who've actually used these tools.

## How It Works

### Finding Your Tool

1. Browse by category (freelance tools, team trackers, billing software)
2. Filter by what matters to you (features, price, platform)
3. Read detailed breakdowns and real user reviews
4. Make an informed decision

### Listing Your Software

Building a tool? List it here and reach people actively searching for solutions like yours.

1. Submit your listing with details, features, and pricing
2. We review it (usually within 48 hours)
3. It goes live in our directory
4. Keep it updated as you ship new features

## Our Principles

**Accuracy First** - We verify information, test tools, and update listings regularly. If we don't know something, we say so.

**Users Win** - Our loyalty is to people searching for tools, not companies selling them. We succeed when you find the right fit.

**Embrace Variety** - One person's perfect tool is another's dealbreaker. We celebrate the diversity of solutions and help you find yours.

**Respect Privacy** - We don't sell your data. We don't spam you. We follow the rules and do the right thing.
